# PreLoader
_Part of LiteLoaderBDS_

## What is this?
This is a PreLoader for [LiteLoader](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LiteLoader). It will load LiteLoader before the BDS starts.

## Why do we need this?
LiteLoader requires to use MCAPI, which is magically provided by PreLoader.

## How does it work?
We uses windows delay load to expose and remap original bds symbol to our own symbol, and then we will provide them to plugins.

## How to use?

### As a end user
Put the `PreLoader.dll` into the same folder of bedrock_server.exe, and run [PeEditor](https://github.com/LiteLDev/PeEditor) to patch the bedrock_server.exe.

### As a developer
You should use [SymbolProvider](https://github.com/LiteLDev/SymbolProvider) and delay load option of linker to use the symbols. Besides, to link the BDS's symbols, you should use the libs generated by [PeEditor](https://github.com/LiteLDev/PeEditor)
